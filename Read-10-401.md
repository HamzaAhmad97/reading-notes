## Stacks and Queues

When you think about it, singly linked lists are actually stacks since they themselves consist of nodes, and each node can only reference the node next to it, but they can not reference the ones behind them, in case of singly linked lists.

When dealing with stacks, we will encounter terminologies like pushing, and poping. When we push to a stack, it is like saying we put something on top of the stack, but when we say poping, it is exactly the opposite to pushing, where we remove an item from the stack. We can also name the top of the stack, and when peek, we actually view the top of the stack, but note that when the stack is empty an exception should be raised. Another property that it related to stacks is isEmpty, which returns true when the stack is empty, and true otherwise.

Depending on the order we push and pop items from a stack, we have two known schemas for that, LIFO which stands for Last In First Out, and FILO which stands for First In Last Out. LIFO means that the last item pushed to the stack will be the first to be popped, while FILO means that the first item to be added to the stack will be the last to be popped, which when you think about it, they are the same concept but from different perspecitves.

This image shows a representation for the LIFO schema:

Pushing something to the top of the stack makes the last node to be pushed the top of the stack, while when you pop the top, top becomes the node next to the popped node.

### Pushing with O(1):

The time and space complexities will be always O(1) since this operation is not dependent on the number of nodes in the stack.

1. New node will have a value, but its next property will be equal to Null.
2. Assign the next property of the new node to point to the top of the stack.
3. Assign the top property of the stack to point to the new node.

### Pop with O(1):

Since popping from a stack is only concerned with removing the top node, we do not need to loop over all nodes like the linked list to pop a specific node. Note that we should check for isEmpty to avoid any errors when popping.

1. Create a temporary reference to the top node.
2. Assign the top property of the stack to point to the next node to the node to be removed.
3. Now clear the next property for the node via accessing it by the variable temp, and set its next property to Null.
4. The garbage collector will handle the rest regarding cleaning and disposing.
5. Return the value of temp.

### Peek with O(1):

Jut for inspecting. Also requires checking isEmpty.

* Just return the value of the top property of the stack.

### isEmpty with O(1)

* Only check if the top property of the stack is Null, or does not hold a reference to any node.

Talking about Queues, when we say enqueue it is the same as saying that we are adding nodes to the queue, dequeue means removing from the queue, but it should raise an exception when the queue is empty. The first node in the queue is called the front, while the last node is called the rear. To peek is to view the value of the front node in the queue. isEmpty() returns true when the queue is empty, and False otherwise.

As for stacks, queues follow two schemes regarding the order of how nodes get enqueued and dequeued. FIFO stands for first in first out, so that the first node added will be the first to be dequeued, and LILO, which stands for Last in last out, so that the last node added is the one to be dequeued lastly. 

The image below shows a representation for a queue:

### Enqueue with O(1):

Does not depend on the number of nodes in the queue.

1. Set the next property of the rear node to point to the new node.
2. Set rear.next to point to the new node.

### Dequeue with O(1):

Check isEmpty to avoid any possibilities of errors.

1. Create a temporary reference called temp to make it point to the front node.
2. Assign front to point to the next node to the node that is about to be removed.
3. Assign the next property of the removed node to Null.

### Peek with O(1):

* Just return the value of the front node.

### isEmpty with O(1):

* just check if front is equal to Null.
