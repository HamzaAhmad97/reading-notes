# Authentication & Production Server

## JSON Web Tokens

A JSON web token is JSON with some extra structure. JWTs include a header and payload that use the JSON format. Optionally, the tokens can be encrypted or signed with a message authentication code (MAC). Signed tokens are commonly referred to as JSON web signatures (JWS) and encrypted tokens as JSON web encryption (JWE).

The JWT is formed by concatenating the header JSON and the payload JSON with a dot “.” and optionally folowed by the signature. The whole string is then base64 URL encoded.

A common use case is for instances where there is a need for HTTP request states to remain with the client. This is often the case with RESTful API implementations. A RESTful web service cannot keep a client state on the server and still strictly adhere to a stateless model, semantically speakiing. Using a JWT allows the client to provide state information to the server for each request. This is especially helpful in secured RESTful web services that require some form of client authentication and authorization control.

JWT authentication is used for token authentication and it is really a popular method for authentication in Django. JWT stand for JSON Web Token. We first install the packages:

```
pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
pip install djangorestframework
```
Then we create an app specifically for this purpose, so with basic setup, we end up having something like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
...
'rest_framework_simplejwt',
'rest_framework'
...
]
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
   )
}
```

Then we add two URLs, one for generating the token, and the other related info like the username, and the other one is responsible for authentication using generated token.

```python
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import (
   TokenObtainPairView,
   TokenRefreshView,
)
urlpatterns = [
   path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
   path('api/token/', TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='t
oken_obtain_pair'),
   path('api/token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), na
me='token_refresh'),
]
```
## Production Servers

When a request arrives at your server that is not local, it should be passed to a dedicated web server. Nginx is an example for a good web server.

This is an application, it is known that it is great at serving static files from disk like CSS files and so on and handling multiple requests at once. If the request is not for a static file, but should be processed by your application, the webserver is configured to pass this request to the next component.

Django projects provide a `uwsgi.py` file, it contains a function that gets called by the application server, the function gets python object representing the incoming request. This function calls our code and produces a response object which is passed to the uwsgi server and the thing happens again in reverse, since this gets translated to a HTTP response and gets sent back to the web server and then to the user.
