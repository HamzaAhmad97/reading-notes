## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language used to add more functionality to web pages, since usually a web page consisting only from HTML and CSS codes will not be that dynamic nor interactive, so Javascript comes to the rescue by its advanced features and fast execution. Moreover, Javascript usually comes to play along with the other two languages mentioned before, namely, HTML and CSS, where it can access HTML elements and alter thier presentation which is altered by CSS.

## The Syntax

As for any other programming language, Javascript has its own set of rules to define variables, commands and so on. 

#### Variables

Variables are considered a vital combonent in Javascript, where they are used to either hold reference to a specific peice of data, or store the data itself. Variabes in Javascript must start with letters or underscores, but they should not include any special characters, as they also should not be themselves any of the reserved words like **var**.

#### Control Flow

Control flow means the way or the path your code is taking to reach some conclusion or result, and in Javascript you can manipulate or alter the final result by using some of the reserved flow control structures like the if/ else statement for instance, the following image shows a schematic diagram of control flow using if/ else statement.

#### Expressions and Operators

An expression is a set of values that is operated upon via some kind of a command or operators, and the defining character of expressions is that they always return a value and can be assigned to variables.

There are a number of types of operators on Javascript, operators usualy operate on at least one value, depending on thier functionality, and they return another value, the most basic example on operators is the plus sign '+' which is used to sum two numbers and return the result.

##### Types of Operators:
* Assignment operators --> **Example: =**
* Comparison operators --> **Example: >**
* Arithmetic operators --> **Example: +**
* Bitwise operators --> **Example: >>>**
* Logical operators --> **Example:||**
* String operators --> **Example: +**
* Conditional (ternary) operator --> **Example:  ? :**
* Comma operator --> **Example: ,**
* Unary operators --> **Example: delete**
* Relational operators --> **Example: in**

You can check the [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comma_operator) to learn more about operators.

## Adding Javascript to Your Code

JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses `<link>` elements to apply external stylesheets and `<style>` elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML â€” the `<script>` element, here's an example:

`<script src="myScript.js"></script>`

Now by knowing the know hows of HTML, CSS and Javascript, you will be abe to make wonders, and trust me, it is really fun and challenging at the same time.
