## Assets, Metadata, and CSS in Nextjs

### What does it mean to be a static file?

Before I start, I noticed that I have never looked up the meaning of a file being static, but the explanation is simple, it is any file that gets delivered to the end user without being generated like HTML files for example. We notice that CSS files are kind of read-only, they do not get modified, and they get delivered as they are, many files are static, at least within the context of web development in general, images, scripts and so on follow the same idea because when you think about it, HTML files that get rendered utilize the accomapnying static files that kind of operate or change things in those HTML files, or, they only get shown there as they are like images.

### Images in Nextjs

Now, talking about Nextjs, it serves static files within the _public_ directory at the root level of our Next project, and we can include or add many types of static files in there like CSS files and images. Notice that does something for us, we do not have to be so concerned about the images that we want to deliver, Next provides the _Image_ component which is like an regular HTML image element on steroids, it takes care of optimizing and loading those images when they are being viewed, when they are visible in the viewport, and if you think about it, this is a huge deal since it enhances performance greatly, and I think such thing will be more apparent with those with slower connections. Also, this works for any image source.

Next optimizes images on-demand, which means that build times will not be increased like what happens with static site generators.

In fact this also brings the usage of the term _lazy_ into attention, with NExt, images are lazy loaded, just like explained before, if the image is not shown in the viewport yet, this means that it will not be loaded until then. A lazy process, is not a slow process, but instead, it is a process that waits for another process or event to take place until it gets executed, and when it comes to images with NExt, loading images kind of keeps waiting until the image is being viewed, then the actual loading happens, I think.

This is how we might use the image component provided by Next:

```javascript
import Image from "next/image";

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="<image-source>"
    height="<image-width>"
    width="<image-height>"
    alt="<alternative>"
  />
);
```

### Metadata in Nextjs

We already know that metadata is referred to as the data that ships with a file that contains extra but sometimes necessary data related to the file being served. When talking about HTML files, some elements are more apparent than many others like the _title_ elemtn which is part of the _head_ element or tag.

In Next, there is also the _Head_ component that comes in place of the regular head element, and we can put such metadata like the title within this component.

### CSS styling in Nextjs

In Next, we use a library called **styled-jsx**, in my opinion it is kind of similar to styled components, it allows you to write CSS within React components and this will not affect other components since they are out of scope.

In fact this is so similar to styled components, but anyway, we can create kind of a wrapper component that takes the children property from props and renders it inside of itself. We can then add styling to this elemtn by creating a CSS module. CSS modules are also plain CSS files, but the difference is that when you have a look, they usually only contain declarations or rules for classes, also, their names are usually like this: `styles.module.css`. What you need now is to import styles from this module and then to access the class you want ot use for your component just access it like via dot notation: `className={styles.something}`, and you are good to go. Notice that in the actual DOM, you will notice unique and weird class names, so the possiblity of collisions is brought to minimum.

To use regular CSS, just create that CSS file, and import it in the file _pages/\_app.js_. Note that we can not import this file anywhere else, but still, by doing this, you made the styles added in that file global and accessible for all pages.

## React Context

Understanding React's context is so easy, consider that your amazing React app is a building, you will mostly need to pass props though your components, because if not, I do not think that React is necessary here, but anyway, you can think of the context as being the water pipes and electricity wires going though the whole building. All floors and apartments have access to those two, and that is it. In React, we pass the things that are kind of global or necessary to all components using the context manager. Talking about buildings again, you notice that we do not pass wires directly though our floors where we can see them, but instead, they are hidden and pass across the walls of the building, we do not have to "drill" to pass wires. In React, we might sometimes encounter the issue of passing props though every single component in our component tree until we reach the component that REALLY needs those props, this is known as **Props drilling**, and we should avoid it since we might affect the performance of our entire app and so on.

Notice that in theory, we might be tempted to thing that we can use the context manager to replace the entire props passing thing, but please don't. Also, the types of data we might need to use the context manager for are those types that should be global or accessible on the go like theme data, user and authentication data and so on.

To get started, all you need to do is to create a context like this:

```javascript
import React from "react";

const MyContext = React.createContext();
```

Then you use the context provider to hold the data you want to make "global" or accessible by child components:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={mydata}>
      <SomeComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Remember that you pass the data you want to the value attribute.

To actually consume or use that data in a child component, you have two options, the first one is to use a context consumer wrapper component, which allows you to access the data in the value attribute directly:

```javascript
function Child() {
  return <MyContext.Consumer>{<div>{value}</div>}</MyContext.Consumer>;
}
```

We can also do it in a different way, by using the `useContext` hook:

```javascript
const mydata = useContext(MyContext)
...
```

You can use other nice stuff like desstructuring and so on to make your life easier.

Lastly, note that we do not always need to use the context manager, just consider if the data you want ot pass should be global, and also, have another look at your organization, maybe changing the way you thought about the whole structure will help.
