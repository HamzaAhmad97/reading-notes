# Django REST Framework Permissions

To permit someone is to give him the accessiblity to do something, and when it comes to the web and specifically APIs it refers to the act of limiting the someone accessing or consuming our API either in terms of the size of the data they are accessing, or maybe the nature of the data itself. In Django, this happens at the very start of a view, where permission checks use the authentication information in the request.user and request.auth. The nature of permission comes in various shapes, so for example, you might allow everyone to access the data in your API, you might also give read-only permission to even to authenticated users and so on.

Permissions in REST framework are defined as a list of permission classes. Permissions are checked before the body of any permission class is run, and if an exception related to authentication or authorization the body of the view will not run. Based on the nature of the exception the response will be sent back indicating what went wrong or why a request has not been fullfilled. So for example, An *HTTP 403 Forbidden response* will be returned if the request was successfully authenticated but permission is denied.

This idea also works for objects, like model instances, which tells if the user is allowed to operate on a particular object. Those are run by REST framework's generic views when `.get_object()` is called. Also, the same happens just like class permissions, if a permission related exception os raised, a correponding response will get returned.

To set the permission policy, you can do that using **DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES** like so:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
Note that the default policy is to allow all users.

We can also set the authentication policy on a per-view or per-viewset basis using the `APIView` class-based views.

```python
class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)

```
When you set new permission classes via the class attribute or decorators you're telling the view to ignore the default list set in the settings.py file.

The *AllowAny* permission class does not restrict the user regardless if they are authenticated or authorized. *IsAuthenticated* denies permission to any unauthenticated user. *IsAdminUser* denies permission to any user, unless they are among the staff or admin. *IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly* means that if the user is authenticated, then they can perform any request, and if not, they only get read-only access.

We can also implement custom permissions by overriding `BasePermission` and implementing either or both of these methods:

- `.has_permission(self, request, view)`
- `.has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)`

They should return True if the request if the request should be granted access, and False otherwise.

```python
if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
    # Check permissions for read-only request
else:
    # Check permissions for write request
```
