## Dynamic Routes

Next defines routes based on the concept of pages. So for example, when we have a path that looks like this `pages/about.js` this maps to `/about`. But that main idea here is to handle or deal with dynamic routes, the ones that depend on a piece of data that changes like the id of a post for example. When you naviagate to the details of a post with the id 1 for example, the path will look like this `.../posts/:id` where id will be 1 here. In Next, we can give names to files that are wrapped within square brackets like this `[id].js`.

To navigate to such dynamic routes, you can use the *Link* component by giving it the path as a string to the *href* attribure. But you can also make the process dynamic by getting the id's of the pages that you want and then mapping them to Link components. The Link component can also accept objects for href instead of hard-coded URLs.

To access the parameters in your page, you can get the information you want from the router, you will have to import `useRouter` and get the router object.

## Deploying NextJs Apps

The first thing you will need is to push to Vercel, which is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.


Create an account and import your GitHub repository. Once it is done building, get your deployment URLs, and then you will be able to see your app live.
