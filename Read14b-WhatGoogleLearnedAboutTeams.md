## Google and the perfect team

This story basically summarizes the professional life of a girl named Rozovsky, this girl was looking for a job, but not any job, she has tried several jobs like being a researcher and consulting, however, she was feeling that she has always wanted a job that is more social and to be a part of a community. Things develop when she goes to business school, at first she joins a study group, but she does not feel like she really belongs, not that she is not as smart or anything, but the issue was that she felt like she was always under stress, she felt like she always needed to prove herself in front of everyone, as she also noticed that the rest tried to do that to show authority and so on, although she says that most of them were much easier to talk to or work with individually or face to face. After that she joined another group for case competitions, in this team she did not feel the same as in the first group, but instead, she felt more comfortable, that she is not going to be judged, and anyone could say anything they wanted with no fear, in addition to being friendly individually. 


This is not particularly about Rozovsky's life, which has later got hired by google to work on social studies related to teams. Overall, her work pivoted around the concept of **perfect team**, or in other words, what makes a team a good one, and why some teams are more productive than many others. 


In summary, the early stages of her work did not manage to find a clear distinct feature or trend for teams that perform above average, they did not manage to find one pattern, but they found a plenty, which made the study harder.  


The idea is that, it was not necessary for good team's members to share the same experiences, going to the same college or liking the same movies, but in the contrary to this, she hoped that if that was true, then the factor is clear, but that was not the case. There was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. 


However, it is agreed upon that, for teams to succeed, members have to respect others' differences, they have to have some kind of emotional intelligence towards their colleagues. We might be tempted to think that teams that consist of a number of smart members with strict rules and an allocated time for each one to speak their minds are more successful, but in fact, the opposite is true, as mentioned before, members can interfere with their colleagues while they are talking, they can take as much time as they want to discuss their ideas, and all of these help building teams that are more productive and more efficient.


So, people have to be themselves when they are members of teams, they do not have to have the same experiences, and they might not be going out together after work, but giving everyone a chance, and reducing the possibility of being judged is the key.
