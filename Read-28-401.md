## Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices

We should take into consideration that we are prone to encountering lots of potential issues when it comes to managin Django settings. In general, usually we will be using different configurations that work for certain environments and do not for other environments, like the production and development environments. Also, it is possible that we will be having data that should stay private for each project and should not be exposed. Other issues include sharing settings between team members and the confusion that can happen sometimes since settings are actually wrote in Python.

One of the ideas is to create a separate settings file and name it settings_local so that it is used in development and gets ignored in production. But with this method we could lose some of our Django environment settings.

We could also have a separate settings file for each environment, which allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers. Thsi is done by creating a settings directory that contains different versions of the settings file for each environment. But still, we need a way to handle secret passwords and tokens. 

We can solve the issue of sensitive data by using environment variables, and we can use **django-environ** to handle this.

We could also split settings by the source: Django, third-party and our custom settings. 

Naming conventions are also a way which allows us to mitigate the complexity of naming variables. It is recommended to follow the following points when it comes for our custom project settings:

* Give meaningful names to your settings.
* Always use the prefix with the project name for your custo (project) settings.
* Write descriptions for your settings in comments.

Among the best practices when dealing with Django's settings are:

* Keep settings in environment variables.
* Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
* Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
* Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
* Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.

## How Does SSH Work

SSH which stands for Secure Shell keys that are used to authenticate privileged users and to establish trusted access to critical systems like application servers virtual machines and so on. They can also be used for secure machine-to-machine automation for critical businesses.

SSH is a type of network protocol that creates a cryptographically secure connection between two parties. SSH authenticates the parties involved and allows them to exchange commands and output via multiple data manipulation techniques. It uses a symmetric cipher system like AES, Blowfish, 3DES, CAST128, and Arcfour to encrypt the entire connection, asymmetric encryption during the initial key exchange process to set up the symmetrical encryption and for key-based authentication, and hashing to generate hash-based message authorization codes (HMAC) that ensure a received message's integrity is intact.

For a client and a server, it is like when they both negotiate the encryption of the session based on what protocols they support. To do that, they both user a verion of the algorithm to create a private key via an agreed upon seed value and ecryption generator as well as a public key.
