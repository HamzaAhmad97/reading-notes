# Hashtables

Hashing is the process of taking a string and converting it into another type of value that can be used to for other purposes like determining the index of an array in the case of a hashtable. When we refer to what is stored or contained in each index of the array, it is called a bucket, and it could contain multiple key/ value pairs in a linked list if a collision occurs, and collisions themselves is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

Sometimes a lot of poeple confuse dictionaries with hashtables, but a dictionary actually uses a hashtable under the hood since they utilize key value pairs, so each thing contained in an array's index, a bucket or a node has both a key and a value.

What happens is that instead of looking up an array for example for a specific value by just iterating over all the elements in the array, we could hash or encode the value itself, a string for example, to an index, which will be used to store that value at that index of the array, so the lookup process will execute in constant time instead of growing linearly based on the length of the array.

We will need a hash function that takes a key and returns an integer, which is the index that will be used to store the key/value pair in the array. This hash code is calculated in constant time too.

To turn a key into a numeric number, we could start by adding or multiplying all the ASCII values together of the individual characters in the string. Then we multiply that value by a prime number, then we use the modulo operator to get the reminder of the result when divided by the total size of the array, and lastly, we insert the key into the array at that index.

Note that since each index of an array can hold many types of values, we make use of that so that each index of the array contains buckets, and each of these buckets holds one key/value pairs, and the result will be initialized to Null.

There is something called collision which happens when two keys hash to the same index in an array. To solve this issue, we could use a linked list, so that for the keys that hash to the same index value, they get appended to the linked list, which means that they will point to each other, and we then can find the key/value pairs we want by iterating over the linked list. This is why we call each index of the array a bucket, since it can contain more than one key/value pairs at once. But care must be taken since in each node in this linked list, we do not just store the values that correspond to that key, but instead, we store them as key/value pairs even if they share the same key.

So in general, when we want to write or store in a hash map, we take the key, and then we hash it to get the index where the key/value pair will get stored, and when we want to read from the hash map, we also do the same, since we need to hash the key in order to calculate the index where the key/value pair were stored, and we use regular array indexing to do that, so it is a very fast approach.

We should take care of the sizes of the buckets, since we do not want our hash table ot be packed or dense, and if the hash table had more buckets, then it will be more sparsely populated. We could make use of a thing called the "load factor" which tells something about how full the hash map.

Hash tables have some internal methods like **add()** which works on adding key/value pairs to a hash table. The way this method works is so simple, it first calls a method that returns the hash code, and once you determine the index of this key/value pair, you check if the index contains something already, and if it does not, just store the pair at that index, and if it does, then store the pair in the data structure at that index.

The **find()** method does the opposite to add, but they both share the same functionality in terms of calculating the index first, but the difference is that find will just use array indexing to get the pair. If the index contains a data structure like a linked list, the method should iterate or look up that data structure to find the pair.

**contains()** accepts a key, and returns True if the key exists inside of the hash table. **gethash()** accepts a key as a string, conducts the hash, and then returns the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.
