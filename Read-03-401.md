## Read & Write Files in Python

Files are simply stores used to store data in specific formats, there are a variety of file types, from simple text files to images and so on, when processed by the computer, the bytes representing the data, it turns it into binary.

Similar to HTML files for example, files also consist of a header that contains information and metadata about the contents of the file, then comes the body of the file, which is basically the data itself, and lastly, the footer of the (end of file) which is just a simple character indicating the end of the file.

The data itself can be interpreted diffirently based on the format of the file which can be inferred from the extension of the file.

In Python, to open a file, you first have to specify the path to that file, which consists of the folder path, the file name in addition to the extension of the file, then you can use the `open` function which is built in: `file = open(<file-path>)`

Note that using the `open` function on its own requires an extra step after you are done with the file, that is closing the file, in order to avoid data leakage and similar issues, this is done by calling the `close()` method of the file instance: `file.close()`.

In order to automate the task and to avoid forgetting about closing the file, we can use a try statement, and this is useful for two reasons, to handle of something happens when opening the file and also to guarntee the file will get closed no matter what:

```python
file = open(<file-path>)
try:
  ...
finally:
  file.close()
```

A better option would be using the _context manager_, which starts with the keyword `with`, and accepts an alias to represent the file instance:

```python
with open(<file-path>) as f:
  ...
```

Note that the with keyword can be preceeded by more than one open function meaning that we can open more than one file at once.

The open function can also take an optional argument which specifies the mode of the processing we are goind to do on the file:

- 'r' -> read (default)
- 'w' -> write
- 'rb', 'wb' -> read or write binary (by byte data)

To read data from a file, you can use diffirent methods on the file instance which differ by the size of returned data, so for example, the method `.read(size=value)` method reads from the file based on the number (value) of bytes, or the entire file otherwise, other methods exist like `.readline()` and `readlines()`. We can then iterate over the returned data for further processing.

To write to a file you simply do the same thing, but with the writing methods you pass the data to those methods, examples on these methods are `.write(string)` and `.writelines(sequence)`. Note that writing to a file completely deletes all of its contents, so if you just want to update the file, just use the append mode 'a'.

## Exceptions in Python

It is important to distinguish between two types of errors, syntax error result when the interpreter faces a Python code that is written in a wrong way, while, on the other hand, exception errors get raised when a correct python code causes an error, a typical example on that is when you try to open a file by specifying the file path wrongly.

To raise an exception, use the keyword `raise` followed by the function `Exception(<error-message>)`.

There are many different types of exceptins that get raised, among the most famous ones is the assertion error, which gets raised when the condition following the `assert` keyword evaluates to false.

To handle exceptions gracefully, we use the try/ except statements, we include the code that can possibly cause a problem or raise an exceptin inside the try block, and if an exception gets raised, the execution moves to the code inside the except block. Note that you can add more than one except statement following the try block to handle more than one type of exceptions.

```python
try:
  file = open(<file-path>)
  ...
except FileNotFoundError:
  # do something
```
In case you wanted to run a piece of code if no exception get raised, you can use the `else` statement to do that which follows the except statement, but if you want to execute a piece of code in all cases, you can wrap it inside a `finally` statement, usually for cleaning up, like for closing a file after it has been opened.
