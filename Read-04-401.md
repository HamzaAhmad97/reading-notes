## Classes and Objects

Classes are blue prints for creating objects, they are like a describtion on how to create an object. Objects on the other hand are entities that can be defined by their attributes and what actions they can take. Classes define types in almost all programming languages, we create instances from those classes and we use them by accessing their properties and by execution their methods. Moreover, objects hide thei implementations and expose you a set of attributes and methods that you can use on them or get from them, and usually we do not have to worry about the innners that much.

To define a class in Python, we use the keyword class, followed by the name of the class, the convention is to use upper camel case for classes:

```python
class Car:

  origin = 'China'

  def __init__(self, color, manufacturer):
    self.color = color
    self.manufacturer = manufacturer

  def drive(self):
    print('driving'0)

```

In the class's body, we define class specific attributes, that can also be accesses from its instances. The special method `__init__ ` is called the constructor method, and it gets called the first thing when creating an instance from the class, we pass to it the bare minimum data to get the instance up and running. `self` is actually a reference for the current instance of the class, and it must be the first parameter of every method we define inside the class, as it is also used to reference any of the attributes of the instance be first starting with self.

Methods are not that different from regular functions that we are used to, but they must have a reference to the object as their first parameter.

To create an instance just add the name of the class followed by a pair of parantheses, and inside of them we pass the data necessary to instantiate the object.

```python
my_car =Car('blue', 'Audi)

```

To access the attributes and the methods of the object just use the dot notation:

```python
my_car.drive()
my_car.color

```

## Thinking Recursively in Python

A recursive funciton is a function that calls itself somewhere inside of its body, a term known as self reference. A good way to understand how recursion works is by visualizing the stack, where as we know, when a function is called and still does not return, it is kept on top of the stack until it returns, so we come to the point when we need a base or a terminal value that the function will not call itself again if reached or we will get stuck.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

### Fixtures 

Usually in simple python tests using Pytest we define the unit tests for functions and so on, and usually we keep defining the required data for each function inside each unit test so that the test runs as expected, however, when we have a more complex data structues like files and objects, it is better to define them in a way so that they are available to all unit tests in testing module and that is basically the definiton of a fixture.

To state that a function is a fixture you include a special decorator above the function: `@pytest.fixture`, then you pass this function (that returns for us a piece of data we want to use in more than one unit test, maybe all) to the unit tests that need the data to operate correctly:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def get_data():
  ...

def test_some_function(get_data):
  ...

```

We are basically saying that this fixture represents the data we want.

### Coverage

Usually, we can not make sure that our tests cover all of the necessary aspects for some functionality, since code can do so many different things, like returning values, raising exceptions and so on. 

The solution for this problem is to use a package called *pytest-cov* on *PyPI*. Using the command `--cov` alongside the Pytest command will show you a coverage record for every part of a library your code uses, as you can also show the report in a more readable format as an HTML page by typing `coverage html` after the pytest command.
