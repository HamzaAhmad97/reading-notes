# Django

Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication like signing in and signing out and so on and Django actually gives you read-made components to handle all os these stuff.

When a request is sent to a server, the first thing that happens withing Django is that it tires to figure out how to handle such a request by inspecting the URL itself via something called a **urlresolver**, and what this does is basically trying to match the URL with one of the patterns already stored in the server, Django checks patterns from top to bottom and if something matches, Django will pass the request to the associated function, and in terms of Django, this function is known as a **view**.

In views, many things can happen, like just retrieving some data from a database, or changing something, or even just to render a simple HTML page using a **template** that can be either dynamic or static. 

Django also relies on the concpet of **models** which is the representation of the way we model our data and organize it, and this is usually tied to the database part. So for example, if a template needs some data from the database, this returned data will get sent in a strucutured manner, and that is why refer to it as a model.

Among the concepts we consider when dealing with Django is the object-relational mapper, which refers to the act of defining our data models entirely in Python which allows us to get a rich, dynamic database access API, and this can also be written in SQL too. For example, this is how you might define a model for a band:

```python
class Band(models.Model):
    """A model of a rock band."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    can_rock = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

When it comes to URLs and views, it is recommended to use beautiful and concise URLs, we ususally define a mapper between our URLs and views, when Django recongnises a URL pattern, it heads to the corresponding view to do the necessary actions.

```python
...
path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search')
...
```

Django also uses a special templating language which allows you to create and build dynamic web pages using HTML, you can also extend templates, use them inside of each other, and so on, which is so flexible and gives you a lot of flexibility. You will usually include the values and expression within curly braces with two percentage signs.

Django also provides powerful tools for handling forms, user authentication and it supports the concept of internationalizatoin.

Django is open source, it is managed by a non-profit organization which is the DSF. It is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django fellows and a larger group of contributors.
