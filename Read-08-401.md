## List Comprehensions in Python

We usually tend to use for loops and similar methods to create or modify lists, but python offers a more concise way of doing similar things called list comprehension.

The general syntax of a list comprehension follows this syntax:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in list]
```

The way it works is that it is similar to creating a dummy empty list, then creating a for loop, and inside of that for loop you do some operation on the element in the old list, then you append it to the new dummy empty list, but list comprehension allows you to do that without much of a fuss.

### Example: creating a list from range with list comprehension:

```python
new_list = [i for i in range(5)]
```

This code does exactly as this code:

```python
new_list = []
for i in range(5):
    new_list.append(i)
```

### Example: creating a list from range and doing an operation:

```python
new_list = [2**i for i in range(5)]

```

This code does exactly as this code:

```python
new_list = []
for i in range(5):
    val = 2**i
    new_list.append(val)

```

### Example: extracting values following a pattern:

```python
data = "we have 5 cats and 1 car, and we have 2 laptops."
new_list = [i for i in data if i.isdigit()]

```

This code does exactly as this code:

```python
data = "we have 5 cats and 1 car, and we have 2 laptops."
new_list = []
for i in data:
    if i.isdigit():
        new_list.append(i)
```

The functionality is limitless, you can use list comprehensions from reading files, to creating data structures and so on especially if they get combined with other built in methods and functions.
