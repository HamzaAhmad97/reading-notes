# OSS Contributions

It is better for starters to get the hand of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself, regardless of how small it is.

Among the reasons that can motivate developers to contribute to open-source software are:

* To improve coding skills:

    Usually when developers contribute to open source software, they get feedback from the more experienced programmers, it is different than regular projects where the experienced usually do not have the time to provide feedback since they are willing to work on imporving themselves instead.

* To gain early experience:

    Contributing to open source software give developers the ability to do the tasks that they usually do when they work at a company, they will have to read, write and review code, as they also need to communicate with other developers too. 

* To increase community and peer recognition:

    Contributing to open source software also increases the chances of you being recognised by many organizations, as it also helps widening your community circle so you become more engaged with other developers from around the world.

* Greater job prospects:

    While the increase in job prospects at big tech firms is one of the main effects of OSS contribution, there are also a number of other opportunities that can arise, such as consulting and freelance work.
