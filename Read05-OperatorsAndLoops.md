# Operators and Loops

## Loops

Most of the time, you will need a peice of code to execute for a number of times, sometimes you find it easy to type the commandsor linesof code by hand manually when the number of loops or iterations is fairly small, however, things can get so tiring so quickly once the number of iterations increase, so you start to feel the urge to automate such tasks, and thus comesthe term of looping.

As in any other programming language, Javascript offers a number of ways that allow you to loop or iterate in order to execute a peice of code. The list below shows the most common loops in Javascript:

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement

As an example, the following code snippit, shows the general syntax for a for loop:

`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression];[incrementExpression]){`

  `statement`

`}`
  
The image below shows the structure of a for loop.

## Operators


Expressions are lines of code that result with a value, usually, expressions consist of a number of operators that have special functions which also operate on a number of operands to yeild the result, for example, among the logical operators os the 'or' operator or '||' which operates on two boolean values and returns false only if both operands are false.

Types of operators:

* Assignment operators --> **Example: =**
* Comparison operators --> **Example: >**
* Arithmetic operators --> **Example: +**
* Bitwise operators --> **Example: >>>**
* Logical operators --> **Example: or**
* String operators --> **Example: +**
* Conditional (ternary) operator --> **Example:  ? :**
* Comma operator --> **Example: ,**
* Unary operators --> **Example: delete**
* Relational operators --> **Example: in**
