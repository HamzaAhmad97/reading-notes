# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. It was the time when the concept of personal computers was first introduced, but since the computers of that time were so simple, and you could only either play simple games, or do some word processing, it was mostly tied to boys more than girls, so we could say that this event has started shifting the attention of girls more and more from computers. Add to that the fact that girls usuallt are more connected to thier mothers and usually they help at home, which is somehing good generally, but all of this caused women and girls to abandon computers at that time.

2. If I understand the quesiton correctly, which is like why it did make a difference tha boys played on computers while growing up, is that because they grew up with more experience with computers, not necessarily computer sceince, but the experience itself made computers something normal to them especially when they would go to college, so they used to find it more easy to adapt and learn new things instead of spending time learning to use the computer itself, which is among the reasons that led males to dominate the computer world, but now it is completely different, computers are so small that we can carry them in our pockets, and everyone has no issues using it.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies

1. Having a look at these graphs, you say, oh wow, this says much more than what we see. We notice that generally the percentage of males in tech is considerably bigger or ahead of that of women. We also notice that it seems like people with brighter colors are also dominating the tech world compared to people with darker skin. However, we also notice that some companies managed to somehow equalize these percentages by opening the door for people of different ethnicities.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. Diversity efforts are more successful when leaders show and actually commit. This is because people with authority or power tend to make other people follow them and act similir to them, especially when it is something useful and helpful.

2. Diverse companies perform better due to the effect tha diversity brings to teams in general, so as stated in the text, these teams are smarter and more effecient since diversity in ethnicity brings diversity in ideas and perspectives, and all of this reflects on the companies themselves, allowing them to perform better.

3. For example when you employ a number of people for especially handling people with certain disabilities, this will help widening your users base, and give a better picture about the entire company.
