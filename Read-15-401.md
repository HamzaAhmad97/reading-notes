## Trees 


Trees are a common data structure that also relies on the idea of having nodes that hold values and that are also connected to each other via references stored in them. From their names, trees consist of nodes that when connected will look like a tree because the root branches to other nodes, and the branches keep branching and so on. Tress also share a set of terminologies, like a node, which is the basic unit in a tree, and it holds a value, and a reference to other nodes. The root is the node at the beginning of the tree. We also have K, which is a number that specifies the maximum number of children a node can have in a k-ary tree, so for example, if we are having a binary tree, this means that each node is allowed to reference or connect to other two nodes tops. Also, in a binary tree, since we have two nodes connected to each node, we give them the names right and left. Since nodes connect to each other, they connect via what is called an edge, which is simply a link between a parent and a child node. A leaf is a node that does not have any children but is connected of course to its parent node. Considering the height, it refers to the depth of the tree, or in other words, it means how many edges we have until we walk directly from the root towards the last child or the leaf node.

### Traversal in Trees

#### Depth First

Is when the priority is to move through the depth of the tree, and we have various ways of doing that, where each one of them differs by the order in which we search the tree:

* Pre-order: root >> left >> right
* In-order: left >> root >> right
* Post-order: left >> right >> root

So for example, if we are to do the pre-order depth first search, the order in which we will do that on the tree above would look like this: 

1 >> 2 >> 5 >> 6 >> 3

So we basically consider each parent node as the root node for a sub-tree, and re do the same order again.

Commonly, we rely on recursion to traverse through the tree, where we rely on the call stack to navigate up back when we reach the end of a sub-path.

##### Pre-order

```python
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```

Basically, the way traverals happens via this order is that we start by the root node, and each node we pass on will get its value printed. Now for the first time we call the function that does the traversal and print the passed node, it will then get added to the stack. Next, as stated above about the pre-order, we will now check if the node has node to its left, and if yes, we will call the function again, which means that the left node will get printed and then added to the stack after the root node. Now, again, for this node, we will check if it has a node to the left, if yes, we will call the same function on this node which will cause its value to be printed, and it will also get added to the stack on top of the other two nodes. We then check if that node has a node to the left, if not, we check for the right node, if it also does not have one, then this means we reached a leaf node, and our function now will return, which means that this last leaf node will get popped out of the stack, which leaves us with two nodes, the toot, and the left one. Now the function called itself in the first if statement since it was the node to the left of its parent, so we continue to the next if statement which checks for the node to the right, if it exists, it will cause the function to call itself on the node, which will get it added on top of the stack after the first two nodes, its value will get printed, and again we keep checking if it has a node to the left and right and so on.

When you consider the other two orders, the post-order, and the in-order, you will notice that the three parts of the function also remain, but the difference is by the order they are put in the function, so for example, for the in-order, notice that the if statement that checks for the left node comes before the statement that prints out the value of the node, then comes the if statement that checks for the right node.

#### Breadth First

Traversal in breadth first search happens by going over each level in order, so if we had the same tree we discussed above, then the output of searching the tree will look like this:

1 >> 2 >> 3 >> 5 >> 6

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-tree.png)

Also, note that breadth search uses queues for recursion on contrary to depth first search which uses stacks.

```python
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
```

The way depth first search works is not that different, so for example, starting with the root node, we enqueue it and then we dequeue it, then we enqueue its left and right nodes, then in order, we dequeue the left node, but immediately enqueue its left and eight nodes and so on, once we reach a leaf node, it will just get dequeued then we move to the next node in the queue until the queue is empty.

## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

#### Breadth First Traversal

The same approach is followed with k-ary trees when it comes to breadth first searching. For every time we enqueue a node and it becomes the front of the stack, we dequeue it and then we check if it has any children, and if it does, we just enqueue its children. 

```python
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    for child in front.children
        breadth.enqueue(child)
```

### Adding a Node

For adding a node, we do not follow a predefined rule of where the node should go, but instead, it is recommended to go through the tree using breadth first search where we will only focus on adding the new node to the first node that does not have all its children filled unless we want a node to be placed in a specific location.

### Big O

* Inserting new node -> O(N)
* Searching a specific node -> O(N)
* Node insertion using breadth first insertion -> O(W), W is the largest width of the tree.
* Perfect binary tree (every non-leaf node has exactly two children) -> O(log(N))
