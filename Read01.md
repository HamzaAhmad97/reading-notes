# About Github Pges and markdown.


## Github Pages

GitHub allows you to build and create or sorts of things, like websites for example, but options can get overwhelming and confusing even if you are an expert, so GitHub Pages comes for the rescue. 

It allows you to create amazing websites to show the world what you can do like your portfolio or your dream project. Pages's capabilities lets you focus on building what you want without the need to focus or shift your attention to how your websites are going to be seen or published which is the best advantage of GitHub Pages. 

## Markdown

Markdown is a way to take plain text and make it so you can add code formatted correctly like italics, headers, links without as much effort as coding it in html directly or something like that. 

Mostly, you will only need to include some special characters or symbols along with the text you are going to format, and you will see how the text will show up based on the way you formatted it using markdown syntax. 

For example, this is the syntax used to markdown a list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

While the code in HTML that will show the same list will look like this:

`<ol>`

`<li>First item</li>`

`<li>Second item</li>`

`<li>Third item</li>`

`<li>Fourth item</li>`

`</ol>`
