To me, the moral of the whole story is that we should think twice before embarking on doing something in general, not just when it comes to coding and building software. Someitmes it is better not to give software the absolute authority to operator on its own, but it should always be mentored and carefully inspected especially when it comes to human's health and body because software will always lack other forms of intelligence like emotional intelligence for example. Also, most of the time, when software encounters something that it is not familiar with, it freaks out and might cause detrimental consequences.

From **[BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)**.

Advancements in technology has led to a huge flow in data compared to what we were used to in the past, this might be ok, we can exploit this data in a way that can be useful for both the customers and the providers or the sellers when we talk about music industry for example. But when we do not have a predefined schema for our data things get messy, and this data can be exploited for unethical purposes like knowing the race, sexual otientation and religion of the data source, which can be used to discriminate against that person just becuase they are who they are. So, organizations have to enforce collecting agreed upon types of data as they also should enforce and restrict the types of applications such types and amounts of data can be used in.
