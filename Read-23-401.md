# Django Custome User

## Django Customer User Model

Its is always recommended to use a custome user model for all Django projects since it provides more flexibility for the developer. 

To start, just create a new Django project with a single basic app as usual, but do not migrate or make migrations. We will use the **AbstractUser** model to create our custom use model since it provides more default configurations than the other models.

This requires four steps, at first we start by updating the configuration of the project via the settings file, then we create a new CutomeUser model, then we create a new UserCreation and UserChangeForm, then lastly we update the admin.

After updating our settings file, we then head to create a CustomUser model which has one method which is the magic method "str", then we create a new module named files under the accounts app, and in that file, we create two forms, one for creation, and one for change. Lastly, we head to he admin module and we register the CustomUser, and the CustomUserAdmin models. After that we update the redirect URLs, and finally we create our templates which will inlcude the login, logout forms, as well as what the user sees when they login or sign up. Also make sure to update the urls files in both the apps and the proejct.

## DjangoX

DjangoX is seemingly a tool or just the same framework but with some default configurations, and ready baked stuff, like user log in/out, it also handles static files with Whitenoise. The styling is is with Bootstrap v4, and debugging with django debug toolbar. It also provides some configurations for forms.
