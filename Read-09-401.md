## Dunder Methods 

Dunder methods are special methods that we define inside classes, and they provide more functinolaity to those calsses, but usually in terms of making user defined classes and objects behave similarly to built in types like integers, so for example we can sum or add integers together but we can not add other two user defined objects directly without utilizing these methods.

As an exmple, we use the len() method to return the lenght of a list or a string, but we can also use the `__len__` method to emulate that and retun a value when the len function is called on our objects:

```python
len("hello") # 5

class MyClass():
    def `__len__(self):
        return self.item_count * 10
# assuming that self.item_count holds 10 instances
myObject = MyClass()
len(myObject) # 100
```

This design is called the Python data model, and it makes that part of Python look like an API where you can just use built in methods and customize them as you need. A piece of functionality is exposed and is free to use and it is our role to implement them.

We have the `__init__` method which allows us to initilize instances when they get created by passing it the necessary information you aim to include in the instance. Other methods we have like `__str__`, `__repr__` which allow us to define the shape of the object when it gets printed or passed to the functino str(), so for exmaple, if you define the `__str__` method so that it returns the class name of an object, you can just include `return self.__class__.__name__` in the `__str__` method, and when you print the object for exmaple, the name of the class will get printed.

Other methods like `__len__` allow us to get the length of our object regardless of what length means to your object, so for example, say we have a class representing a car, you might for example use the `__len__` method to return the miles the car drove when the instance is passed to the len() function. The method `__getitem__` defines the behaviour when we try to index our object like for lists `myList[1]`, so based on the properties in your class, you can define this method so that it returns some value when the object is indexed. We have also the `__reversed__` method, which allows us to make our object reverseable, I mean not the object itself, but the property that gives to reversing the object a meaning.

We can also use other methods for usage when comparing or equality, so for example, we can define the method `__eq__` to use when testing for equality, and the method `__lt__` for when the operator larger than is operating on the object. We might have two account objects, but since equality for objects by default is based on thier references, it will not evaluate to true even if both accounts contain the same amount of credit, or if they belong to the same customer, so be redefining those methods, we can specify which property to actually use when we use such comparison operators on our objects. But note that for binary operators, we might need to define or add a second parameter to such methods which will refer to the other operand.

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    return self.credit == other.credit
```

We can also extend the functionlity of our classes by making them addable, which means that we can make them valid to be added to other instances of the same class using operator overloading via the method `__add__`. Functions are objects by nature, but the defining characteristic of functions is that we can call them like this `print()` by adding paranthises after them and passing whatever arguements they need, but we can actually do the following with our custom objects, by using the method `__call__` we can make our object callable. As we also have other methods that we can use with context managers like `__enter__`, and `__exit__`.


## Basic Statistics in Python

Probalbility is the defined as the chance of something happening, so for example, we usually say that the probability of getting a head or a tail when tossing a coin is 50% because from experience we assume that when flipping a coin we only have two possibilities, which are either head or tails, altough when trying to actually flip a coing many times, we might not get 50% exactly, or we might even get a completely different number each time. When we say it is 50:50, we refer to a more specific definition, we define the sample space which represents the possible events that can happen for some action, and for flipping a coin, we only have the event of getting heads or tails, but the limit that the actual numbers result at when flipping so many times will probably be so close to 50% for both events.

Probabilities provide us with theories, while statistics provides the tools to test those theories using data. We usually rely on measures that are descriptive in nature like the standard deviation and the mean, which allow us to gain insights about various events without the need of doing real exparementation which saves us time in lots of cases and also since many cases are difficult to be tested just like flipping a coin.

For a normal distribution plot, normal distribution is a distribution of the probabilities across all of the events. The x axis takes the actual events or the data points and the y axis represents the probability associated with each event.

Notice that a point with a higher probability reflects a high value on the y axis, thus the line plot will of that point will be relatively higher for that point or event.

When we plot two distributions of two groups and they seem to overlap heavily, it indicates that they are very similar and might even indicate that both group are actually belonging to the same group, and vise versa.
