## How to Use The Random Module in Python

The random module offers a number of functions that allow you to generate random numbers, retrieve a random instance of a sequence and so on. These functions can be used to simulate randomness when needed, and among these functions are:

* `random.randint(<smaller int>,<bigger int>)` -> generates a random integer between the low and the high numbers.
* `random.random()` -> generates a random float between 0.0 and 0.1
* `random.choice(<sequence>)` -> return a random element from the sequence.
* `random.shuffle(<list>)` -> shuffle the items in the list sot that their ordre is random.
* `random.randrange(<start>, <stop>, <range>)` -> generate a randomly selected element from a range.

## Risk Analysis in Software Testing

Risk in general refers to the probability of an unwanted incident, so risk analysis refers to the act of identifying these risks in a given application or a software so that they get more poriority in testing. This also involves the impacts of risks in addition to categorizing them.

When writing tests for a software, we take into account the tests that are involved in writing the test themselves along with the possiblity of the damage they might cause. These kinds of risks might include the usage of a new hardwarek new technology, new automation tool, modifying the sequence of the code and the availability of test resources for the application, knowing that some risks are unavoidable like the time that you allocated for testing

Among the best practices is to conduct a risk assessment meeting, to allocate maximum resources to work on high risk areas, creating a risk assessment database and identifying the risk maginitude indicators including high, medium, and low. Risk identification includes categorizing the typr of risk, which includes it being a business risk which might come form the company or the customer, other sets include testing risks, premature release risk, software risks. 

We can approach the risk by knowing about the perspectives of risk assessment which include effect, cause and likelihood (propability). And finally, to perform risk analysis, start by searching the risk, then analyzing the impace of each risk, and finally developing measures for the risk identified.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage refers to the amount of cases testing actually covers, and usually this amount is not implied from numbers just like that, but instead we rely on other measures to find out.

The issue of using just numbers to represent the amount of testing is somehow misleading, for example, if someone says that his test coverage is about 90%, this does not mean that they covered 90% of the cases that their code might encounter, but instead, this could be due to the fact that they are testing using low quality testing, or tests that look for things that rarely go wrong. On the other hand, very low coverage numbers indicate that test barely cover any cases, so we should take into consideration both cases.

Take into consideration that sometimes testing can be excessive and might lead to wasting time, and if changing a small part of the code causes long changes in the tests might indicate that there is an issue with your tests. Also, if your tests are taking so long to finish, this does not mean that you are having good coverage or so many tests, and you can move some of the tests for a later stage.

## Big O Notation 

To try to calculate the Big O efficiency for an algorithm, you can follow these tips:

1. Different steps get added: which means that if you are having two for loops in a row, and the efficiency for each of them is say O(b), O(a) then the efficiency for both of them is O(a+b) which is equivalent to O(N), since the N here is just the result of an equation, and adding a+b knowing that they are both linear does not change the result.

2. Drop constants: if the complexity of two loops in a row is O(N), then from tip 1, we should add them, so that we get O(2N), however, just as for tip 1, the constants do not matter, since this is still linear.

3. To help calculating, give each different input a different varaible, say we have to inputs along with their operations in a row, then we should add and we get O(a+b) regardless of the actual value that a or b represents, meaning that a might be equivalent to N^2, but this is calculated later once you specify the variables.

4. Drop non-dominate terms: meaning that if we end up calculating O(N+N^2) then we simply drop the N term since it is smaller in magnitude than the N^2 term, and we get O(N^2).
