# Tailwindcss and Nextjs

## Tailwindcss

Tailwind allows us to write less and do more, it basically utilizes the concept of utility classes which are a set of classes that are defined for us so we do not have to write our CSS from scratch. These utility classes bundle or combine lots of preconfigured styles, so it makes our CSS much smaller and shorter.

All you have to do is to just go to tailwindcss's website, and just search the things that you need, and you will find a variety of utility classes that are ready to use.

This is an example of how we might use Tailwindcss:

```HTML
<button class="py-2 px-4 font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md text-white bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700">
  Click me
</button>

<button class="btn btn-green">
  Button
</button>

<style>
  .btn {
    @apply py-2 px-4 font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md;
  }
  .btn-green {
    @apply text-white bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700;
  }
</style>
```

Also, in case you wanted to make your HTML cleaner, you can just use the @apply operator which allows you to combine or group a set of chosen Tailwindcss utility classes under once custom class.

## Next.js

Nextjs is a react framework library that helps us to deal with issues or challenges related to code bundling, compiling, produciton optimizations, and many other issues, as it also provides an excellent developer experience when building React applications.

To start, head to the terminal, and use `create-next-app` along with the name of the app. Then, to start the app, run the command `npm run dev`, then the app will run on a local development server, like localhost. You will see a page that says "welcome to next.js!".

Next allows developers to either render pages at client side, server side or both. Usually, the pages that are highly dynamic need to be rendered at the server side, while the less dynamic or static pages can be left to the client side.

And as dicussed before, Nextjs comes with great performance since it handles all the things that we usually need to configure or have at the client side like code splitting, bundeling and so on.
