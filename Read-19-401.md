# Automation in Python

## Python Regular Expression

Basically, regular expressions are a string or a sequence of characters that allow us to capture particular patterns in strings or text in general. Regular expressions are used in so many areas, like validating emails and with Django for matching URLs, and in many other fields. To work with regular expressions in Python you will have to import a built-in module called "re" which stands for regular expressions, then to start using regular expressions, you will need to use raw string literals, in Python you can do that like this `r"<regular-expression>"`. This module exposes a number of methods and functions that allow you to match, find, replace the matchind patters in a text like `search()`, and `findall()`.

* To match a character as it is, just type it inside the regular expression: 

    `r"A"` -> will match the letter "A".

* To match anything, you can use the wildcard character which is the dot:

    `r"The letter ."` -> will match any string that looks like this "The letter A" for example.

* To make sure that a character or a set of character must come at the beginning, you can use ^:

    `r"^Item count:"` -> the letter "I" must come at the beginning. You can use the doller sign "$" to indicate that the thing must come at the end.

* To match a set of characters, just put them between square brackets:

    `r"[a-z]"` -> will match any of the lower case letters.

* You can use a perdefined set of sequences to match special set of characters, like alphanumeric characters for example using "\w":

    `r"\w+"` -> match any alphanumeric characters.

* To escape any character that has a special task in the regular expression, you can use the "\" backslash.

* You can also specify the repetition for a character or even a pattern, you can use "*","+","?". For example, the star indicates that we want to match either zero or more times of the pattern. You can also use curly prackets to specify the number of repetitions explicitly `r"\w{1,2}"`.

* As you also have the ability to group specific set of characters together, and even access other nested groups inside them.

## shutil - High-level File Operations

A module that allows us to do operations on files like copying and archiving with high effeciency.

* To copy the content of a file to another, you can use the `copyfile()` function. You can also use `copy()` which works similarly to Unix's `cp` command. Note that with copy, the permissions of the file are copied along with the content. We also have the `copy2()` function which can access metadata as well. 

* `copymode()` is used to copy permissions from one file to another.

* `copystat()` is used to copy other metadata about the file.

* `copytree()` is used to copy a directory tree from one place to another.

* `rmtree()` is used to remove a directory and its content.

* `move()` is used to move a file or a directory from one place to another.

* `which()` is used to scan a search path looking for a named file.

* `get_archive_formats()` returns a sequence of names and descriptions for formats supported on the current system.
