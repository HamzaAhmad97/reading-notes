Linear regression is the act of trying to find a straight line that best fets a set of data. For example, you might plot a set of data like the size of a real estate vs the price, on the x axis you might define the size, and on the y axis you might define the price. Every point on the plot will represent a size and its corresponding price. You might not always find a straight line that passes though all of the points, but the main point of linear regression is to find one that tries to model the data with the least error margin.

To do that, we can use a library called Scikit-learn which is a poerful Python library dedicated for machine learning. 

So we first start with collecting our data, usually using Pandas' dataframes, and once we are done with exploring and clearning the data, we can head to work.

For linear regression, we might have what is known as the independent and the dependent variable, so for example, if we are talking about the size, it is considered the indpendent variable, and the price will be the dependent variable, since it might be depending on the size, or any other features.

With Scikit-learn, we start with importing the linear regression object, then we define our independent variable which is here the price. 

To generate the linear model, we use the method fit() of the linear regression object, and we pass it the x and y values defined earlier. Then if we plot the result, we will see something similar to the image above. 

If you want to evaluate the prediction for some arbitrary price value, use the predict() method and pass it the x values. This might yield bad estimations, and we can confirm that by eye and by calculating r^2 or the mean square error. If the mean square error yields a big error, it means that maybe using one feature is not a good predictor of target feature.

To solve such an issue, you might need to do train-test split, where you split the data into groups for testing and and validating.

You can use residual plots to check and visualize the errors in your data, so if you have done a good job, the data should be randomly scattered around line zero, but if there is some kind of structure, then the model is not capturing some things.
