# Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods are special methods that we define inside classes, and they provide more functinolaity to those calsses, but usually in terms of making user defined classes and objects behave similarly to built in types like integers, so for example we can sum or add integers together but we can not add other two user defined objects directly without utilizing these methods.

As an exmple, we use the len() method to return the lenght of a list or a string, but we can also use the `__len__` method to emulate that and retun a value when the len function is called on our objects:

```python
len("hello") # 5

class MyClass():
    def `__len__(self):
        return self.item_count * 10
# assuming that self.item_count holds 10 instances
myObject = MyClass()
len(myObject) # 100
```

This design is called the Python data model, and it makes that part of Python look like an API where you can just use built in methods and customize them as you need. A piece of functionality is exposed and is free to use and it is our role to implement them.

We have the `__init__` method which allows us to initilize instances when they get created by passing it the necessary information you aim to include in the instance. Other methods we have like `__str__`, `__repr__` which allow us to define the shape of the object when it gets printed or passed to the functino str(), so for exmaple, if you define the `__str__` method so that it returns the class name of an object, you can just include `return self.__class__.__name__` in the `__str__` method, and when you print the object for exmaple, the name of the class will get printed.

Other methods like `__len__` allow us to get the length of our object regardless of what length means to your object, so for example, say we have a class representing a car, you might for example use the `__len__` method to return the miles the car drove when the instance is passed to the len() function. The method `__getitem__` defines the behaviour when we try to index our object like for lists `myList[1]`, so based on the properties in your class, you can define this method so that it returns some value when the object is indexed. We have also the `__reversed__` method, which allows us to make our object reverseable, I mean not the object itself, but the property that gives to reversing the object a meaning.

We can also use other methods for usage when comparing or equality, so for example, we can define the method `__eq__` to use when testing for equality, and the method `__lt__` for when the operator larger than is operating on the object. We might have two account objects, but since equality for objects by default is based on thier references, it will not evaluate to true even if both accounts contain the same amount of credit, or if they belong to the same customer, so be redefining those methods, we can specify which property to actually use when we use such comparison operators on our objects. But note that for binary operators, we might need to define or add a second parameter to such methods which will refer to the other operand.

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    return self.credit == other.credit
```

We can also extend the functionlity of our classes by making them addable, which means that we can make them valid to be added to other instances of the same class using operator overloading via the method `__add__`. Functions are objects by nature, but the defining characteristic of functions is that we can call them like this `print()` by adding paranthises after them and passing whatever arguements they need, but we can actually do the following with our custom objects, by using the method `__call__` we can make our object callable. As we also have other methods that we can use with context managers like `__enter__`, and `__exit__`.

## Iterators

We can use the `__next__` and `__iter__` dunder methods to iterator over objects in *for-in* loops. An iterator must implement these two special methods to operate like an iterator. An object is said to be iterable if we can get an iterator from it just like we have with lists and tuples. 
 
The `iter()` function calls the `__iter__()` method and returns an iterator from that object. The `next()` function is used to iterate through all the items of an iterator, when there are no more items to be returned, a *StopIteration* exception will get raised.

```python
vals = [1,2,3]
my_iterator = iter(vals)
next(my_iterator) #1
```

## Generators

Generators are considered a simpler way for creating iterators. Defining a generator can take the shape of a regular function, but instead of the return statement, it uses the `yield` statement, and it returns one value at a time that can be used outside of the body of the generator and then once we are done with that value, the execution flow returns back to the body of that generator again and so on. It is like the yield statement pauses the execution of the function. Note that generator functions can inlcude more than one yield statment not only one.

```python
def gen():
    yield "hello"

my_gen = gen()

next(my_gen) # "hello"
```
When the funciton terminates, a *StopIteration* exception is raised.

Note that the local variables defined inside the body of generator funcitons are remembered even after yielding a value, not like regular functions, where local variables get destroyed once the function returns.

We can also use generators in for loops directly:

```python
for hello in my_gen():
    print(hello)
```

We can also create generator expressions which look similar to lambda functions definitions, they also look like list comprehension expressions, but the difference is that they do not return all the values at once, but instead, they return one value at a time. They are known to have lazy execution, meaning that they produce items only when asked for or used. They are also more effecient than regular list comprehensions.
