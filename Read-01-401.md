## Pain and suffering

From its definition, a perspective is just the way we see things, this definitely differs or varies between people. Talking about mine with absolute honesty, I do really enjoy experiencing everything, I believe that everything I encounter or experience is an opportunity for me to get stronger and better, even if I fail, this is not absolute, but instead, it means that I am starting from experience not from the absolute beginning. In every difficulty lies opportunity, this is what I stand by, and every day proves this right, so during this course I am truly looking forward to opening my mind and trying new things in order to become a better person in general not just a web developer, I like pain, because it makes me confident that I am evolving and that I am doing something, that I am breaking out of my comfort zone.

To be honest, at first I was a fresh graduate, I tried and tried to find something that requires me to do things, actual things, not just setting there and getting far salary, but unfortunately this did not work, so I heard about this opportunity, and I thought like this is my opportunity to practice what I like, it is really not just about money, but in fact, this has attracted me since I was a freshman in college, I read various books about various topics in programming, but I was a bit lost and confused since I wanted to learn everything at the same time, so this made it even bad, I also took courses at places not allocated for me but I finally managed. So here, I am aiming to build real things with my own bare hands from scratch, while knowing how every part of it works and interacts with each other, I also aim to understand, and count me a fool but, I honestly believe that at some point, I will reach a level where I can actually see things very simple and sharp. I also like looking at code for some reason.

I do indeed want what comes at the end of this journey, I want to become a better coder, I want to understand other's code, I want to make ideas real things, and I want to have a job, but most importantly, I want to find the optimal way to understanding.

I am actually not doing this solely for me only, but this is actually for my family, they rely on me in a way that makes me push myself harder and harder, this is actually a good thing, to keep remembering that there is someone out there hoping you get to become someone who can make a change. I am actually doing this for my community, I see a lot of misconceptions and faulty decision making and I aim to change that someday.

## Big O

Basically, the Big O notation is a notation that is agreed upon which is primarily used to describe the worst case scenario when it comes to an algorithm or an expression in terms of time and space (memory) that is going to be spent and so on.

- O(1) → algorithm will execute in the same time or space regardless of the size of the input. Example: accessing a value of a variable.
- O(N) → algorithm's time and/or space usage will grow linearly with the size of the input (linear). Example: a for loop operating on a variable iterable.
- O(N^2) → time and/or memory usage is proportional to the square of the size of the input. Example: nested loops with variable iterables.
- O(2^N) → time and/ or space usage doubles with each addition to the input. Example: usually in recursion.
- O(log N) → time and/ or space usage is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input. Example: binary search.

## Names and values in Python

Since in Python everything is an object, we should state again that assigning a variable another variable actually does not copy the content of that value but instead it copies the reference for the value or memory location that the other variable refers to in memory, and reassigning a different value to a variable again does not mean that we just replaced the original value, but instead, it means that we actually broke the first link or reference and added a new one to another location in memory, so in summary, assignment does not copy data, and this is also known as mutable aliasing. This also means that operations actually happen on data or values not on the variables themselves.

When a variable is a assigned a value of a type that is immutable, modifying that or operating on that variable like assigning it a different value or adding to it again breaks the reference and creates a new one for the new value since there is no way we can change the value in place.

Changing a mutable type does actually mutate, while changing an immutable type causes rebinding, but we can rebind mutable types in some ways like adding to a list so change is not always the same thing. On the other hand, assignment is the same for both types.

Assigning is not just bound to the equal sign '=', but instead, lots of things are assignments, like defining a class, or in a for loop where the iterator gets assigned continually.

We should take care when passing arguments to functions or local scopes, like passing by reference and value, and since local variables get destroyed once the job is done. We should always try to avoid causing side effects by makin copies of the values passed especially if they are mutable.

Names are not by any mean bound to certain types of values, they can be dynamically reassigned with ease, a variable can reference a regular number, and then it can reference a function with no issue.

By the way, the topic of the video makes it look so simple, but in my opinion this video is a huge deal.
