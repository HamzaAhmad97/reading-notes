# Cryptography

So assuming we have a message that says "hello world", and we wanted to send this message with a carrier that could be intercepted like the old times, for example when you want ask your brother to tell your mother something, and you do not want your dad to intercept the message, so you might try to **encrypt** the message by using some technique that you and your mother can understand, but your dad does not. So you may think about using some arbitrary characters so that each letter can be replaced with only one unique corresponding chatacter. You might also try to shift the letters like Caesar did before. The idea is that you used a secret key to do the trick, meaning that you replaced the characters or the original data with something else that might not does not make sense to the interceptor. Assuming that your dad did not give that message much attention because he thinks this is just a bunch of nonsense, your mother will need to know the key or the technique you used to **decrypt** the message. So by knowing that you used a specific method, she will start to recover the original data by applying the method or the technique in the opposite way, if for example you used a set of arbitrary characters, she will then need to have a dictionary which will have the original letters and their replacements. 
But your dad is also smart, he notices that you tend to use the same set of characters in the beginning of the message, say it is "mom, I need to" as "%/%# & @!!* -/" then your dad might be able to **crack** your code somehow after a number of iterations by doing frequency analysis.

In fact, this is what Caesar has done long ago, with a similar technique, he used to send messages and replace the letters in the message with those that result after shifting the alphabit a known number of times. So for example, if we want to shift the alphabit by say 3, then the "A" would be replaced by "X".

Another family of techniques for encryption are called permutation ciphers, where we do not replace the characters of the message with others, but instead, we take the message and fill the characters into a grid, and to encrypt the message, we read the message in a different order, where the key is the order and the size of the grid chosen.
