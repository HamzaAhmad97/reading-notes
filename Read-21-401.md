# Django Models

## Models

Models are just a tool that gives data structure so that it becomes easier to work with it. When it comes to Django, these models are defined using regurlar objects, and these objects allow us to define the type of the data that they are expected to handle, as well as other prperties and specifications like the maximum value related to that value, for example the maximum number of characters of a character of text field. We can also do much more, as we also should take into consideration that when we select the type of the database we are going to use, we only need to define these models, and the rest will be handled by Django under the hood.

When we start thinking about something we want to model, say for example a person, then we will may need to think about the characteristics that are unique and can be used to define each person and separate them from the others, so for example, to create a model for a person, we might say that it is a good idea to store their names, age, maritial status, job title, and so on, and once we know our fields or attributes we head to create a UML (Unified Modeling Language), something that looks similar to the image shown below. In this diagram, we define a class which is represented by a block, each block of course has a name, the name of the calss, or the model, some attributes, and methods as well, just like regular classes. Now, regadless of the visiblity of these attributes and properties, we will start to see that connections and relations start to appear. For example, if we are dealing with a shop, or a restaurant, then we may consider a model for orders or meals, and if you have a closer look, then you will see that each customer might take or order more than one meal, and this is basically an example on a one to many relationship. There are many other types of relationships, some of them are not directly related to count, like inheritance for example.

To define a model, you will have to head to the `models.py` file, note that each model is defined by a class, and each one of these classes should inherit from the base class defined by `models.Models`. To define a character or text field for example, this is an example of how you might do it:

```python
class Customer(models.Model):
    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length = 20, ...)
    ...
```

Models have a number of fields, each field is just a representation of a characteristic or prperty, for example a customer's age, and when inspecting the database tables, these attributes are actually the columns that make up the tables, and each instance or an entry will have one of each of these attributes or fields. With Django, we can customize these fields in various ways, for example, we can restrict the user from entering an invalid value, or limit the size of the entry and so on, and all of these customizations are usually done by passing extra keyword arguments to the constructor of the field. Some of the example on fields in Django are CharFields, TextFields, IntegerFields and so on.

You can define or add metadate to a model by defining a nested class called `Meta` inside of the model's class, this can come in handy in cases like when you query data from the database, you can specify the order with which the data gets sorted. You can also set access permissions.

We can also define models in for our models which can give them more functionlaity, but usually, we will be using the `__str__` method to return a human readable string for the object since when you have a look at the admin panel and check your models, they will show up in a way that is not easily readable by us humans, so it is a good idea to include such a method. Another one is the `get_absolute_url()` method, which allows us to get a URL for displaying individual model records on the website.

Once we are ready after defining our models, we then head to create the actual records from these models, this is done exactly like when we define an instance of a class, we use its name as the constructor, and then we pass the necessary data for each field that requires it by using keyword arguments. Once we create a record, we use its built in method `save`. We can also access the fields of a model just like reguler Python objects using dot notation, and we can also use the very same approach to modify the values of a field for a specific record.

Then comes the part related to searching for records, each class or model will have by default the `objects` attribute, this allows us to get what we need in various ways, and based on specific conditions by using methods like `all` and `filter` for example. And in the end we should not forget about making migrations.

## Django Admin Site

The Django admin site or application is a special site that allows the admin to manage, inspect, create, add, delete, and modify data directly using the interface. But to be able to use it, the user will have to register all the models to the admin application. Also, note that the admin does not have to worry about organizing or building this interface from the ground, but instead, this will automatically by prepared for them once the base project is first created or initialized.

For the admin to register a model, they should head to the `admin.py` file in the root directory of the project at hand, then after importing the necessary models, they will do something like this to register the models:

```python
admin.site.register(Author)
```
To be able to access and manage the data in the admins panel, you will have to create a superuser.

Once the admin logs in, he will be greeted by a page that looks like the one below:

The admin will see each model created, and once they click on the model, they will see a set of the associated records. The admin will be able to create, update, and delete any of those records from this interface with no need for coding. There are also lots of possiblities for customization related to the way things get shown or presented to the admin, as well as in terms of accessibility.
