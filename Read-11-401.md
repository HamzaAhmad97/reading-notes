## Numpy

### Basics

Numpy is a Python data analysis package, in addition to speeding up the workflow, it also allows us to do operations that otherwise would be difficult to carry on using regular Python lists.

Usually, we would be dealing with comma separated values files, or CSVs, since they can be easily dealt with if converted to matrices for computations and aggregations.

To read a CSV file, we can use the **csv** library in Python. and we can use its reader function, which takes the path of the file, as well as the type of the delimiter. Although the name comma separated values indicates that the values or the items are separated by commas, but in many cases, the delimiter can be anything other than a comma, it can be a semicolon, a slash and so on.

```python
import csv
data = csv.reader(file, delimiter = <delimiter>)
```

This data can be converted to a list, and each list inside of this list is an actual row in the original data, but bear in mind that if the data contains a header, the first row will be that header row, and we should take this into consideration.

To do operations on data using normal ways, it might take us a lot of time and code, but using numpy, we can make this possible with much less amount of code. Note that in numpy, all the data in the supplied list must have the same data type not like normal lists in Python which can take any type of data.

For this read, instead of just copying the same content directly, I prefer to just list the discussed methods and special notes along with some explanations and sometimes examples.

`import numpy as np` → to import numpy, the convention is to use the alias np.

`np.array(<list>)` → will return a numpy array. The amount of data in the list does not matter, and it can be of a uniform dimension.

Printing such an array would look like this:

`array([ 1,2,3 ])`

array.shape → will return the shape of the array as a tuple, example: (1,3).

Note that the number of elements in this tuple will match the dimension of the array, so for example, if the array contains a list of lists of lists, so 3 dimensional, the tuple would look like this: (1,3,3). Here, for a 2 dimensional array, the first element represents the number of rows in the array, and the second element represents the number of columns. Much like a table.

Sometimes, you might not want to create an array from an existing list, but instead you might to create like a dummy array, so the best option is to either create an array of zeros, or an array of random values.

`np.zeros((3,4))` → creates an array of zeros, will be with 3 rows and 4 columns.

`np.random.rand(3,4)` → create an array of random values between 0 and 1.

### Reading Files Using Numpy

`np.genfromtext(<file-path>, delimiter=<delimiter>, skip_header=<int>)` → this function will allow you to read CSV files for example, and generating arrays from them. You need to supply the path of the file, the delimiter, and if the header spans n rows, just pass that number to the skip_header argument to avoid getting errors since the header usually contains strings stating the nature of the data for that column. The datatype will be picked automatically by numpy.

### Indexing and Slicing Arrays in Numpy

Knowing that arrays in numpy are zero indexed like regular lists, you can simply access individual items by passing the row and the column index of that item.

`array[2,3]` → return the element in the third row, and the fourth column.

Note that the number of arguments passed between the square brackets is dependent on the rank, or the dimension of the array, so generally, the syntax might look like this:

`array[dim1, dim2, ....]`

but also notice that for every single argument, we can slice, or select more than one instance at that dimension, so for example, this is how we return or select the first 2 rows and the first column:

`array[0:2, 0]`

Indexing here and slicing follow the same thing with lists in Python.

To select an entire row, select one row and select all the columns using ":", and to select an entire column, select that column, and select all the rows using ":".

`array[1, :]` → all row

`array[: , 1]` → all column

### Assigning Values

`array[2,3] = 5` → assign an individual element.

`array[: , 5] = 5` → assign an entire column, so that all the values along that column will be 5 now.

### One Dimensional Arrays (Vectors)

To get a vector out of an array, you can just slice it to get a row or a column, and that would be a vector, knowing that the resulting list is 1 dimensional, meaning that it does not contains any other lists or arrays.

Once we get a vector, we can then index any element in that vector using regular list indexing:

```python
vector = array[:, 2]
item = vector[3]
```

`np.random.rand(5)` → generate a vector which has a length of 5 containing only random numbers.

### N-Dimensional Numpy Arrays (Tensors)

This might look something like this:

```
earnings = [
    [
        [500,505,490],
        [810,450,678],
        [234,897,430],
        [560,1023,640]
    ],
    [
        [600,605,490],
        [345,900,1000],
        [780,730,710],
        [670,540,324]
    ]
]
```

If we were using regular lists, we would be accessing an element in the list like this: `earnings[0][0][0]`, but with numpy, we can do the same like this: `earnings[0,0,0]` . We can also carry out indexing and slicing as discussed before.

### Numpy Data Types

Datatypes in Numpy are a bit different than those in Python, since Numpy is written in C.

`array.dtype` → returns the datatype of the elements in the array. Example: `dtype('float64')` . Datatypes in numpy usually end with a suffix indicating the number of bits of memory they take up.

### Converting Data Types

`array.astype(int)` → convert the datatype of the whole array to an int. But note that most of these methods actually return new arrays instead of actually changing or mutating the original array.

[`array.dtype.name](http://array.dtype.name)` → return the datatype of the array as a string.

You can also directly create a Numpy dtype object like this: `np.int32` and then you can supply it to the `astype` method.

### Numpy Array Operations

- Single array operations

We can do the usual operations on numpy arrays like addition and subtraction, the operation will be carried out on all the elements of the array individually.

Example: `array[ : , 11] * 10`

This will also return a new array with the elements modified, but if you want to just modify the array in place, assign the value back like this: `array[ : , 11] += 10`

- Multiple Array Math

This will apply the operation on the corresponding items in both arrays.

`array[ : , 11] + array[ : , 11]`

Note that such element-wise operations can only take place if the arrays are of the same size, otherwise, numpy will try to broadcasting to try to match up elements.

- The last dimension of each array is compared.
  - If the dimension lengths are equal, or one of the dimensions is of length `1`, then we keep going.
  - If the dimension lengths aren’t equal, and none of the dimensions have length `1`, then there’s an error.
- Continue checking dimensions until the shortest array is out of dimensions.

(50, 3) and (3,) are compatible.

(1,2) and (50,2) are compatible.

(50,50) and (49,49) are comatiple.

### Array Methods

We have many methods that allow us to do simple operations like sum, mean, std, min, and max.

`vector.sum()`

Note that there is the axis argument that can be supplied to tell numpy over which axis or dimension to carry out the operation, for example, if we are having a two dimensional array:

`array.sum(axis = 0)` → sum over the first axis of the array (in every column, across rows)

`array.sum(axis = 1)` → sum over the second axis of the array (in every row, across columns)

### Array Comparisons

`<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, and `==`

carrying such an operation over an array will return an array or boolean values, where False will replace the item that its operation returns False, and the same for True.

`array[ : , 3] > 2`

returns `array([False, False, False], dtype=bool)`

Then we can use such an array to do subsetting:

```python
good = array[: , 3] > 2
array[good, :]
```

Such comparisons can be more complex.

### Reshaping Arrays

We can reshape an array while maintaining its elements.

`np.transpose(array)` → get the transpose of an array, meaning to flip the rows and the columns, so an array of shape (1,2) will become (2,1).

`array.ravel()` → transform the array into a one-dimensional representation.

`array[1 , :].reshape((2, 6))` → reshape the one dimensional array to an array of two rows and 6 columns.

### Combining Numpy Arrays

`np.vstack((arrayA, arrayB))` → combine two arrays sharing the same number of columns, so they get combined by adding their rows.

`np.hstack((arrayA, arrayB))` → the same as vstack, but when the arrays share the same number of rows.

`np.concatenate((arrayA, ArrayB), axis=0)` → does the same as either vstack or hstack, depending on the axis you provide.

## JupyterLab

Is a web-based use interface for Project Jupyter. It enables us to work with documents and activities of various types in a felxible manner.

It allows us to arrange mulitple documents and activities side by side in a work area using tabs and spliiters. Among the features we have:

- Code console, which provides us with the ability to run code interactively with ruch output.
- Kernel-backed documents, which enables code in any text file.
- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into thier own tab, side by side with the notebook.
- Multiple views of documents, which enables live edit of documents reflected in thier viewers.

As it also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats, as well as a set of customizable keyboard shortcuts.
