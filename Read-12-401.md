## Pandas

Pandas is a Python package that is mainly used in scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. It is built on top of Numpy, which is very popular for its support for multi-dimensional arrays. Pandas allows us to easily navigate, aggrigate and clean our data, and the unit block in any project that uses pandas is called a dataframe which is kind of a table but with much more functionality.

`import pandas as pd` → to import pandas

### Object Creation

`pd.Series([1,2,3,'a'])` → to create a pandas series. Pandas will also include an integer index column.

`pd.DataFrame(<np array>, <index>, <columns>)` → to create a dataframe from a numpy array, provided that you can provide the index column and the headers row.

`pf.DataFrame(<dictionary>)` → allows you to create a dataframe from a dictionary, knowing that the keys will represent the headers, and the value of each column will be the actual data in each corresponding column. Each column can have a different datatype than the others.

### Viewing Data

`df.head()` → view the top 5 rows of the dataframe.

`df.tail()` → view the last 5 rows of the dataframe.

`df.index` → view the index columns, might differ depending on how it was defined.

`df.coumns` → the names of he columns or the headers of each column.

`df.to_numpy()` → convert a dataframe to a numpy array, can be a heavy task if the datatypes in your dataframe is not of the same type.

`df.describe()` → shows a quick statistic summary of your data, like the sum, the mean and the standard deviation.

`df.T` → to get the transpose of the dataframe, exchanging the rows with the columns.

`df.sort_index(<axis>, ascending=False/True)` → to sort rows based on values in a column, you can also specify the order or the direction of sorting.

`df.sort_values(by=<column name>)` → will sort the dataframe rows based on the the column selected.

### Selection

`df[<column name>]` → select a column, will return the column along with its index column.

`df[ a : b ]` → selecting rows from a to b.

`df.loc[<label>]` → selects the row with the corresponding label.

`df.loc[: , [colA, colB]]` → to select a multi axis by label.

`df.loc[labelA, labelB, [colA, colB]]` → label slicing.

`df.iloc[3]` → iloc is used to select by position, meaning with numbers or order. It can also be used for ranges like `df.iloc[3:5, 0:2]`.

`df[df[col] > 0]` → used for boolean indexing, which means that the rows and columns that match this condition will get returned.

`df.copy()` → to return a copy of a dataframe.

`df[colName] = [...]` → will create a new column and append it to the end of the dataframe.

### Setting

`df.at[dates[int], label] = value` → to set a value by label.

`df.iat[int, int] = 0` → to set values by position.

### Missing data

`np.nan` is usually what replaces missing values.

`df.dropna(how="any")` → to drop any rows that have missing data.

`df.fillna(value=<value>)` → to fill missing data.

### Operations

`df.mean()` → returns the mean for every column, you can select the axis.

`df.apply(np.cumsum)` → an example of applying a function on a dataframe like cumulative sum.

`s.value_counts()` → to return a series of a histogram like.

`s.str.lower()` → applying string methods

### Merging

`pd.concat([list of dataframes])` → will combine them together.

### Grouping

`df.groupby(label)` → to group by the label, like a pivot table. Can be applied on multiple columns.

`pd.pivot_table(df, values="D", index=["A", "B"], columns=["C"])` → pivot table.

### Categorical

`df["grade"] = df["raw_grade"].astype("category")` → convert grades to categorical data types

Can also be used with matplotlib to plot

`df.to_csv(path)` → convert the dataframe to a csv file.

`pd.read_csv(path)` → read a csv file.
