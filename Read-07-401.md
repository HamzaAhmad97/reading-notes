## Python Scope: **global** and **nonlocal**

Scope basically refers to the range or the place in code that something has access to or can be accessed from, this does not only apply to variables, but functions, objects and classes also comply to this rule.

In general, we have two means of identidying scope, we say that a name is global because it can be accessed from anywhere in the code, while a name is said to be local because it can only be accessed from within an enclosing scope, like a variable defined inside a function, or function parameters. We also have nonlocal names, which refer to objects that can be accessed form inside nested functions but they can not be modified or updated. However, we have the global and the nonlocal keywords which allow us to modify the standard behaviour of scopes.

Usually, when you define a local variable inside a local scope like a function, it will be local to the function, even if you attempt to modify a global variable by naming the local variable the same as the global variable. the `global` keyword allows us to access the global variable with the same name as the one inside of our local scope, knowing that trying to modify the global variable thinking that it is ok without defining a local variable will cause an error.

The global keywords is added before the variable of interest, and then any modification to the variable will reflect on the global one, since we are explicitly telling python that we are aiming to modify the global variable. This can also be used to create lazy global names by declaring them inside a function.

```python
name = 'John'
def modify_name():
    global name
    name = 'Legend'
    ...
```

As for the global keyword, when we encounter nested functions, we might end up seeing that the contianing function contains a variable that can only be read from the nested function but not modified, however, using `nonlocal` we can have the ability to modify nonlocal variables:

```python
def parent_func():
    var = 0
    def nested_func():
        nonlocal var
        var = 1
        ...
    ...
```

But bear in mind that this keyword cannot be used outside a nested function since it will cause an error.

## Don't be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!

Aside from discussing the terms time and space complexities, we might refer to the big O notation as a measure of how well an algorithm might perform as the size of inputted data increases, so it is just a tool, and it is helpful when we want to compare efficiencies of algorithms given the same data. So we are usually not interested in the best case scenario but rather in the worst case scenario so it tends to be a more reasonable.

There are a number of orders of growth or representations of how time and space usage increase, and they usually represent the relation between the input size compared to running time and memeory usage:

- Constant complexity O(1): the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input.

- Logarithmic complexity O(lg(N)) : The greater the input size, the less the amount of space and time spent compared to the input size itself

- Linear Complexity O(N) : The amount of time and space used by the algorithm is linearly proportional to the input size 

- Linearithmic complexity O(Nlg(N)) : The amount of time and space used by the algorithm is proportional to the input size multiplied by the logarithm of the input size.

- We also have many other orders of growth and some of them grow in dramatic ways depending on the input size like factorial complexity and exponential complexity.

Big O notation is only a mathematical analysis to provide a reference on the resources consumed by the algorithm. Practically, the results may be different. But it is generally a good practice trying to chop down the complexity of our algorithms, until we run into a case where we know what we are doing.
