# Web Pages Structure with HTML and Wireframes

## Wireframe and Design
Wireframing is the act of sketching or drawing a simple sketch of a web page, this is different than designing the real website or how it is going exactly to look, instead, with wireframing, we are concerned with the information hierarchy, or how elements that comprise a page are distributed or organized, at this stage, we are not really concerned with the tiny details, but mostly, we focus on the bigger picture. 

Wireframing is a fun process, but it usually requires you to know a bit about your audiences' background, and the main purpose of the web page you are designing, since all of this contributes in how the user will interact with your page, and to offer as much comfort as possible. 

Wireframing can be done by hand or using software, it usually depends on your choice of preference, knowing that usually, online tools provide more flexibility when it comes to changing your mind or when you commit a mistake. 

The image below shows an example of a wireframe.

## HTML Basics
### What is HTML?

Hypertext markup language or HTML is not actually a programming language, but instead it is a code used to define the structure of a web page. It is used to add any element you need to your web page like regular text, images and links. It is called a markup language because it annotates what is going to be shown in the browser where every special code or symbol will not be shown in the final product.
### Basic anatomy of a HTML element

A web page basically consists of elements like text and images, but the way these items are added is via marking them up using tags, as shown in the image, a tag consists of an opening tag, closing tag, a set of attributes and the content to be shown.

## Semantics

In short, a semantic represents the meaning that something represents or carries. For example, in HTML we can actually use the element <p> for literally all types of text by adjusting its presentation using CSS, but in reality, this will lead to a major issue. The problem with this method is that for people with disabilities who use helping or assisting devices, they will get confused since they will not be able to navigate your site correctly because you have not organized the semantics correctly by using a single element only, the same applies for search engines, since they will be looking for special tags or elements that carry a specific meaning, which will be a criteria that affects the discoverability of your website. The solution comes with using tags or elements that carry meaning, for example, the footer element usually comes at the end or bottom of your page, and usually it holds information about you, the author, and some social media links, so by adding this element, you will greatly help search engines and disabled people to find exactly what they are looking for. 

Semantics is not that simple, and it helps people and search engines alike to find exactly what they are looking for quickly, so I recommend that you visit this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) for more information.
