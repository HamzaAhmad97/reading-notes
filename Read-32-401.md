# React 2

## Conditional Rendering

This is simply done just like in regular Javascript, we can use if statements, logical operators and ternary operators to get components rendered based on various conditions.

## Lists and Keys

The map() method returns a new array where each element in the array undergoes some process, or inother word, we map the original elements and return them in a new array. To loop through an array to display each value in JSK, you will have to use the map method, inside the callback funciton, you will usually return elements containing data or attribute from the original elements in the array, of course you will need to use curly braces if you are doing that inside JSX. Each list item needs a unique key and the purpose of key is to help React identify which items have changed, added or removed.

## Forms

A controlled component is a component that its state is maintained by React in such away that the state is the signle source of truth from the perspective of React since form fields for example maintain thier own state based on the user input, but to deal with them in React, the React state will be the one to be trusted or controlled.

We should update the state as the user types or fills the form fields because we are making the react state the source of truth which also happens to be updated for every change regardless of its size.

We target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field by adding an event listener 'onChange()', and assigning it a callback function that will work on changing or updating the state, so eveytime the user changes or modifies his entry, the state will immediately get updated.

## Lifting State Up

It’s not a great idea to use state in every single component. Having state data distributed throughout too many of your components will make it harder to track down bugs and make changes within your application. This occurs because it’s hard to keep track of where the state values live within your component tree. It’s easier to understand your application’s state, or state for a specific feature, if you manage it from one location.

## Composition vs Inheritance

We can simply think of this be considering these two statements, we can say that a cat is an animal and cats have legs, but also, we as humans have legs, but we are not animals, it is like saying that both of our classes used legs and do not necessarily mean that either of them needs to swtich classes. The same happens in React, but it is not a good idea to use inheritance since it is not necessary. On the contrary, React utilizes composition, you simply notice that many elements can use the same component as many times as they need.

## Thinking in React

A component can be thought of as an element that represents a concrete independent piece of functionality or an interface that is used to build wider UIs, which is just like objects, allows us to hide implementation details and use a higher level interface to interact with that component, although components usually do not depend on the context they are used in on contrary to objects and some functions.

The characteristics of a component can be sorted as follows: Components are made to be reused over and over again while applicable, which allows us to save time and effort. Since components are reusable because they do not depend on the environment or the context they are being used in, they can be replaced by other components when needed which provides a lot of flexibility. Components can be be extended from other components to provide more functionality. Just like objects and even functions, to avoid repeating and wasting time understanding the details of implementation, components offer an interface through which we can use its functionality without the need of even looking into the details behind that component. Lastly, since almost all of components’ characteristics arise form each other, components are also independent, which means that the dependencies on other components and outer code can be brought to its minimum.

The advantages of using the component based design can be sorted as follows: Since components can be replaced with others, this provides ease of deployment, meaning that when there is a newer version of an existing code, the older one can be replaced easily without the need to modify the original code. From the characteristics of components, we can deduct that this architecture saves as time and effort which reflects on reducing cost in terms of maintenance and development. Dealing with component based programs makes it easy to develop which also reflects on the ease of maintenance and evolution since they encapsulate and hide the details and expose interfaces to gain control of the functionality. This is a reliable paradigm since every component is itself considered reliable which affects the overall reliability of the system. Since every component is independent on its own and can be used independently of any context of environment it affects the connectivity of components positively and affects the speed of development as well as productivity.
