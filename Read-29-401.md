# Whiteboard Interview Tips

Basically the main tip is to communicate, but how about that?

Starting directly with the challenge given to you is definitely not the right thing to do at the start of your interview, but there are a couple of steps that you should take before.

1. Restate the question.

Usually you might think that you understand the question from the first statement, but do not trust that, and instead, it is recommended that you try to restate the question to the interviewer in a way that looks like you are explaining the question to the interviewer, and thus, if you state something in a wrong way, the interviewer will catch it and will correct you. Note that this helps a lot since misunderstanding the quesion in the first place might lead you to not solve the question or just wander off away from the right solution or approach.

2. Ask about edge cases.

You should spend sometime before embarking on solving the question, and among the things that this time should be allocated to is to ask about the edge cases, you should ask about the inputs and the outputs, and the potential edge cases especially when the interviewer has not brought them yet. This might take various shapes or questions, like asking about the datatypes passed, the extremes and the values that are usually unique like an empty list for example.

3. Ask about test cases.

It is recommended to ask about test cases since it shows that you know about testing and it also makes your approach test driven so you start testing while you are solving the question which makes you closer to the solution.

4. Write pseudocode.

This helps you to not think about the specifites of a language, and instead allows you to write the code in a way that is close to code but also does not require you to think about one. This might also lead the interviewer in some cases to provide feedback regarding certain things in your pseudocode. 

Also, even if you do not manage to translate your pseudocode into an actual programming language, this might be considered ok since you would have already gained lots of points by then.

5. Write the actual code and ask if it looks good.

If you foget some syntax, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. Also, do not hesitate to ask if the code looks good since this adds up and shows that you communicate and this scores points for you, and that you aim to improve your work.

6. Ask for help.

You might just get a tip for free.

In addition to all of this, it is recommended that you ask about the whereabouts of the interview, like if there will be something specific that I should take care of or prepare, and all of this is helpful to prepare you mentally. Also, remember that it is ok to stress out, you are not alone and lots of other candidates have been in your place before, but is important that you do not just close up on yourself, and try to communicate.
