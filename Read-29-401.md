# Graphs

### Overview

A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes or _vertices_ that are connected to each other via _edges_ which are just connecting segments. A node can have what is known as a neighbor, which is any node that is adjacent to that node. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex or node.

When we talk about graphs, we have two chategories in terms of how edges are arranged. An undirect graph is a graph that has edges that do not point to specific nodes, meaning that these edges are bi-directional since they connect two nodes, so you notice that there is no direction or flow in general. A directed graph is a graph that contains edges that point to specific nodes, you will notice that such edges look like arrows, and the direction of where the arrow is pointing is apparent.

We can use a number of ways to specify the nodes in a graph, as we also have a way to show the number of edges in a graph and what vertices they connect, so for example, if we have an undirected graph that consists of only two nodes, "a" and "b", we can write the following:

vertices = {a,b}
edges = {(a,b)}

But when we have a directed graph, for example one that contains only two nodes, "a" and "b", and assuming that "a" is pointing towards "b", and "b" does the same thing by pointing towards "a" then we can wrtie the following:

vertices = {a,b}
edges = {(a,b), (b,a)}

In terms of how connected the nodes in a graph to each other, we have complete, connected, and disconnected graphs. In a complete graph, all nodes are connected to each other. In a connected graph, is a graph where all nodes at least have one edge. A disconnected graph is a graph that has some vertices not connnected.

We also have cyclic and acyclic graphs, and the difference is that in a cyclic we have loops or cycles, while in an acyclic graph, we do not. Note that these cycles are defined so that the edges start and end at the same node or vertex.

There are two common ways to represent a graph, namely, adjacency matrix, and adjacency list. In adjacency matrices, we define a square matrix that is n\*n in size, where n is the number of nodes. All of what we do is to go through each cell and put either 1 in case the two nodes intersecting at that cell are connected and 0 otherwise, so we end up having a matrix like this:

A sparse graph is when there are very few connections. a dense graph is when there are many connections. Within an adjacency matrix, an undirected graph will always be symmetric. This is not the case for a directed graph.

In adjacency lists, all of what we do is to list all of our nodes in the graph, and then for each node, we have linked list or an array having all vertices that are connected to that node.

We also have weighted graphs, the difference is that each edge will have a number or a weight assigned to it, so when we represent such a graph, in a weight matrix, we put the corresponding weight instead of just 1, and for adjacency lists we put the node followed by the weight of the edge that connects that node to the node at a specific index.

### Traversal

#### Breadth First Traversal

This is similar to how it is done in trees, the idea is that we should have a way to keep track of visited nodes, which can be just a set. Note that the idea of breadth first search relies on the concept of visiting all the nodes that are adjacent to a node and then move outward doing the same thing with those adjacent nodes.


#### Depth First Traversal

In depth first search we use a stack, what happens is that we push nodes to the stack, then we peek at the top node in the stack, and if the top node has unvisited children, we mark it as visited and then we push all its children that are not visited, then if the top node does not have any unvisited children, we pop that node.
