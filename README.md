# Growth mindset
## What is growth mindset?

As I am growing up, I found that it is crucial to have a growing mindset, basically, it is one of the most importnat qualities you should have.

From my point of view, and in simple terms, it is when you belive that you can always get smarter, or that when you belive that everything you face and makes you struggle is an opportunity for you to get stronger and smarter, and this is completely the opposite of what we call a ***fixed-mindset*** which simply refers to the act of giving up or settling down when facing something that is different than we are used to.

## How it affects us and our brains?

It is known that when people belivw that they can get smarter and stronger, they put more effort to the thing they are doing or aiming to do, and this leads to stronger neural links in our brains and thus makes them more powerful than ever, as Albert Einstein said:
> In the Middle of Difficulty Lies Opportunity.-Albert Einstein

## When faced with:

* Challenges, they **embrace** them :grinning:.
* Obstacles, they **persist**.
* Cretisism, they **learn from them**.
* success of others, they **get insoired by them**.
