## In Tests We Trust

Test driven development or TDD is an approach that is used in software development which simply requires writing tests first and then implementing or writing the actual code. In this approach we mainly focus on the overall design of the code, not the implementation of code itself, and this has proven to be a powerful approach.

In Python, the structure of our projects usually includes a testing branch on its own, and in that part of our project we focus on writing tests for our functions and classes by testing a number of inputs and the expected outputs.

The most widely used library for such a task is Pytest, we import it in the file we are going to write our tests in. Note that when we for example are planning to test a function named "get_names" we should name the unit test the same thing except it should start with the word "test", so our unit test should look like this : "test_get_names". In a unit test we usually follow a convention called AAA, where we start by organizing the data that our unit test needs to run, like the arguments that we are going to pass to the function when we evaluate its output, then we store the actual value returned by the function after it gets executed, lastly, we use the assert statement to write the actual test.

The assert statement syntax follows the following syntax:

`assert condition`

if the condition evaluates to true, the test passes, while if the condition evaluates to false, the test fails, and it throws an assertion error. An example on a simple unit test looks like this:

```python
def test_my_function():
  arg = value1
  expected = value2
  actual = my_function()
  assert actual == expected
```

## What does the if \_\_name\_\_ == “\_\_main\_\_”: do?

Basically, there are lots of variables under the hood that python uses to do its job, and we usually should not access these variables because they are allocated for internal use, however, among these variables it the variable **name** which is primarily used to store the name of the module running.

If the source file it being run, the value of name will be main, but if the module is being imported somewhere else, the value of the name variable will be set to the modules name.

This actually can be put to good use, mainly when we do not want a piece of code to run when the module gets imported, a typical example is when you test some code in the module that does not have anything to do with the functionality of the code inside the module, so we better not run this code when the module gets imported given that the module works just as expected. Take a look on this example:

```python
def do_stuff():
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
 do_stuff()
 ...
```

So we do not actually need this code after the if statement to run when the module is imported because the module is set such that its interface is clear and ready to be used.

## Recursion

Recursion refers to the act of a function calling itself. This is a very useful approach for solving many problems and it appears in lots of fields like mathematics.

```python
def func1():
 ...
 func()
```

In recursion we usually need a base condition that is simply a value that the function should not do recursion after or then we would struggle with overflowing the stack and getting stuck, so we define the base condition, and then we break the rest of the problem into smaller problems, passing the function smaller and smaller values every time until we reach the base case.
